# Burning Airlines Server

## Description

First development group project from General Assembly Bootcamp.
Goals:

- To get a working front-end and back-end for a fake airline company.
- To have 4 primary views including creating new flights, listing new airplanes, booking new flights and selecting seats.
- Get a working database using MVC on Ruby on Rails
- Get working front-end using React.js

## Things I learned about Back-end

- If database will have columns that use date and time date. Use them seperately instead of as datetime.
- Remake database as many times as needed before moving on to front end
- json.builder file will need to include associations if want to access data from columns in the associated table from a get request

## Technologies

- Ruby on Rails
- Gems
